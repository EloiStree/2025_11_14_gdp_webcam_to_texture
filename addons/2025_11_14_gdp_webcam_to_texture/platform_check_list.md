My goal is to teach how to hack a game with input and a webcam.
For that, I use three pieces of hardware:
* a simple webcam
* a MiraBox
* an XR headset camera
  * Quest 3
  * Deckard (soon)

The goal of this file is to run this project on all the platforms I own to see if it is still running.
What is important to me is that it runs in the editor on Raspberry Pi 5 and later.

This add-on is very important to me because webcams are the only non-detectable method when you want to teach coding by playing a game.
